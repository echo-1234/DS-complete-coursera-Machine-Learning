### general
`;` suppresses output, this means go to the next one\
`fprintf()`\
`%s` string; `%c` character\
`addpath ('C: Users\Desktop') ` allows to use things under this path while under the current working directory

`help <command>`

### file manipulation
`pwd` show the current directory/path
`load` Load data from MAT-file into workspace.\
`save <file>` save the file under the directory\
`who` show the variables I have in my data file\
`whos` gives the details \

### matrix operation
`rand()`, generate random numbers to fill a matrix\
`hist(<matrix>, <number-of-bar>)`\
`I = eye (6)` generat identity matrix\

`size(A, 2)` give the second dimension of A\
`length(A)` give the length of the highest dimension of A\

`A(:, [1 3])`, get everything from the firat and third column; `:` means all the elements in the row or column\
`A = [A [101; 102; 103]]` appending another column vector to the right\
`A(: )` means put all elements in A into one column vector\
`C = [A B]` or `C = [A; B]` means cocateneanting matrices together (first is parallel and second is vetical)

### computation
`A. *B` element-wise product, produce a matrix of the same dimension of A and B
`a < 3` element-wise comparison and return a matrix of true(1) and false(0)
`magic (3)` row, column, diagnol adds up to the same value
`max (A, [], 1)`, take max of the first dimension of A
`floor(A)` and `ceil(A)` rounds down and up respectively. default is column if not specified
`flipud` flip up down vertically
`pinv(A)` inverse matrix A

### plot
`plot (x, y)`\
`hold on` hold the window\
`xlabel ('value')`\
`lengend ('sin','cos')`\
`print -dpng 'myPlot.png' `will save the plot as a picture in png format

```
figure(1); plot (t,y);
subplot (1, 2, 2); % diveide plot a 1*2 grid, access second grid
ploy (t,y);
```
`imagesc (A)`, represent matrix A with a matrix of color
`imagesc(A), colorbar, colormap gray;` (',', comma-chaining is used for a list of commands)
